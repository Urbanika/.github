## üßê  What is [Urb√°nika](https://urbanika.xyz/),?
We started as a propaganda machine for the crypto-commons. Thanks to the Crypto-Commons Hub and to over 2K donors in Gitcoin and Giveth we crafted free immersive video guides about commoning and the use of decentralized coordination tools for urban changemakers.
You can access and view all our content and courses for free here: https://urbanika.notion.site/

However, even if courses are free, they are not reaching the urban changemakers...
Well, if they are not reaching us, what else can we do that reach them...at their doorstep.

Yes, we're kind of...

but with a badass climate-positive bus! üòéüåª

The goal is to facilitate the transition towards a commons-based (which is climate-positive by default) economy, culture, and politics.
We are focusing on neighborhoods as the seeds of change. Why? Well, easy:

If a group of neighbors manages to solve a problem through peer governance, social weaving, and sustainable practices (environmental, financial, and time-wise), then they will take those learnings or at least conversation topics, to their jobs and other social areas. If this happens over several places across the whole Latin American continent, then a mycelium of commoning will emerge.

## ü§î How are the courses we are delivering to the neighborhoods?
The key elements of our training approach are:

ü§∫ Live group sessions: Two-week personalized training sessions will be offered to groups of 5-50 neighbors divided by street.

üéØ From problem to solution: Within these two weeks a shared problem will be chosen by each group, then we will go from drafting proposals in [Charmverse](https://charmverse.io/) to discussing, debating, and co-creating a shared proposal through consent instead of consensus. Once a proposal is ready, we will aid them in creating a multi-sig wallet through [SAFE](https://app.safe.global/), and fundraising from their neighbors and friends through [Giveth](https://giveth.io/).
They will graduate once their problem turns into a working solution that should be managed as climate-positive street-level commons.

On the web3-side, other complementary lessons will be offered such as token-gating the forum and neighborhood access with phygital IoT, creating a [Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/#/dashboard), and supporting other projects working for the common good at [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/).

We will accompany the neighborhood from problem to solution, and meanwhile that is happening there are some other activities üëáüèΩ

üß∂ IRL practice: On the commoning and climate-positive side, other types of activities are needed to make a shift in the style of living. We offer:
* Social gatherings around the bus with live workshops from local activists about DIY & DIT (Do it Yourself/Together), community gardening, and postCapitalist board games.
* Movie nights on provocative themes such as the privatizing of genes, land, and water, the corporatization of food, and the new World Bank no-ownership economy. These movies will close with a social discussion and the call for a minimum viable action from each attendee.
* Climate-positive demos of the [tech](https://urbanika.notion.site/urbanika/Requirements-for-a-climate-positive-design-of-Urb-nika-s-bus-2e929c8a5e244aef904b44b01afb3c74) used in the bus. These demos will be shown to neighbors, chambers of commerce, municipal councils, and universities to push the retrofitting (update/change) of their current ways to some others that go beyond neutralizing their environmental impact toward actually regenerating soil, water, air, and our relationships with nature.

Once a neighborhood or a street is able to self-manage and turn problems into climate-positive solutions. The street will be considered a Street DAO, its founding neighbors will be recognized as neighborhood assambleists, and Urb√°nika will grant them a borderless knowledge certificate.

The press will be invited, and we will make a big party of it. Then, we will go to the next country, and so on until we reach 20 countries and 40 cities.
