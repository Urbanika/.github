## üßê  What is Urb√°nika (before known as OurVerse)?
A propaganda machine for the crypto-commons, operating through an immersive video course guide on using and applying decentralized coordination tools and techniques at local urban DAOs. The goal is to guide activists into regenerating and re-imagining cities through a solarpunk and crypto-commons-based perspective.
This repository is for storing all things related to the film series production.

## ü§î How?
We will set up an extraordinary environment that facilitates learning through hyper-realistic virtually immersive experiences that are fun, engaging, and easy to digest. The key features of this immersive environment are:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Video Lessons: Teachings are expressed in the form of videos. Lessons go from understanding and claiming an urban commons to managing them as a local urban DAO.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Gammified immersion: After the lesson is presented through the main episode, the student will be able to choose which path to watch: Capitalist or Post-Capitalist.
Each path is shown through a video scenario where the consequences of implementing the technologies/methodologies of the chosen path within the local urban DAO are presented.

3Ô∏è‚É£ IRL practice: After watching those scenarios the student will get an in-real-life challenge to solve within a time limit of three weeks.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Recognition: When the challenge is solved, the student gets a skill badge of completion. And, like in a in game, life points are given for the contribution of taking humanity closer into becoming a regenerative species. In contrast, if the student does not solve the challenge, the life points are given to Moloch. When life points are out, the game is over.
