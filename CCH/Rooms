In the below folder you can find the Hub's rooms and all the artifacts that are part of the physical place. The Crypto-Commons Hub will be one of the main scenarios of Urbánika's series.
All the models are put here as Creative Commons 4.0 so the community can use them to build on top of them and contribute in embettering them for either Urbánika's settings as well as any other virtual reality project.
